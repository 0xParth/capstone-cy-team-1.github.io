Notes:

Please try to stick to the above notes contribution template all though it's not necessary. Since we are in different timezones and remote, it's best to have organized notes.
I have protected the main branch, so any changes will have to go through a PR merge, and before every PR merge, we all (at least 2) will have to review it.

## Scenario
This project is intended to apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework and tools to map a cyber incident and then use the Caldera tool to complete an emulation plan. Included into team's tasks is the deployment in the Cloud of a mock-up scenario that represents the system compromised in the cyberincident studied. 

As a result of the project, with the Adversary Emulation Plan is needed to elaborate Threat Report of the incident analized (including a STIX2.1 JSON representation).
